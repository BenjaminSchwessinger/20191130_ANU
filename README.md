This is a compbio short course based on carpentries material tought with Jana Sperschneider, Kevin Murray, Megan McDonald and others as instructors. There are many helpers.

The material comes from a Kioloa field trip sequencing a tick and a cockroach. The second data set is from "The host-pathogen interaction between wheat and yellow rust induces temporally coordinated waves of gene expression" by Dobon et al. 2016 https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2684-4#Abs1. 

This material is inspired by carpentry (data carpentry and sofware carpentry).
